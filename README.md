# Cosmonic Control Demos

This repository contains demos and examples for [Cosmonic Control](https://cosmonic.com/), an enterprise control plane for managing WebAssembly (Wasm) workloads in cloud native environments.

Cosmonic Control is built on [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.com/), an Incubating project at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/).

## Install Cosmonic Control

In order to try these demos and examples, you will need a **Kubernetes cluster** and an **installation of Cosmonic Control**.

### Install local Kubernetes environment

For the best local Kubernetes development experience, we recommend installing [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and starting a cluster with the following `kind-config.yaml` configuration, enabling simple local ingress with Envoy:

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
# One control plane node and three "workers."
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 30950
    hostPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
```

The following command downloads the `kind-config.yaml` from this repository, starts a cluster, and deletes the config upon completion:

```shell
curl -fLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmonic-labs/control-demos/refs/heads/main/kind-config.yaml && kind create cluster --config=kind-config.yaml && rm kind-config.yaml
```

### Install Cosmonic Control

:::warning[License key required]
You'll need a **trial license key** to follow these instructions. Sign up for Cosmonic Control's [free trial](https://cosmonic.com/trial) to get a key.
:::

Deploy Cosmonic Control to Kubernetes with Helm:

```shell
helm install cosmonic-control oci://ghcr.io/cosmonic/cosmonic-control\
  --version 0.3.0\
  --namespace cosmonic-system\
  --create-namespace\
  --set envoy.service.type=NodePort\
  --set envoy.service.httpNodePort=30950\
  --set cosmonicLicenseKey="<insert license here>"
```

Deploy a HostGroup:

```shell
helm install hostgroup oci://ghcr.io/cosmonic/cosmonic-control-hostgroup --version 0.3.0 --namespace cosmonic-system
```

## Makefile

This repository includes a Makefile enabling simplified usage of Helm commands from a local download of this repository using `make`:

* `make render-<demo name>`: Render chart templates locally and display the output for a given demo (Ex. `make render-blobby`).
* `make helm-install-<demo name>`: Deploy a given demo in a dedicated namespace with an HTTPTrigger. (Ex. `make helm-install-blobby`).
* `make helm-delete-<demo name>`: Delete a given demo installed with `make helm-install`. (Ex. `make helm-delete-blobby`)
