# Blobstore Demo (NATS) for Cosmonic Control

This is a Wasm component that performs a variety of blob storage operations and exposes the results via HTTP. The example is written in Rust, implemented as a Wasm component, and packaged for deployment to Kubernetes clusters with [Cosmonic Control](https://cosmonic.com/docs/). 

While this component was written for Cosmonic Control, you can run it with any WebAssembly runtime that supports the Component Model and the [WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)](https://wasi.dev/) HTTP and Blobstore APIs. The component is available as an OCI artifact at `ghcr.io/cosmonic-labs/components/blobstore`.

When deployed on Cosmonic Control with the manifests or Helm chart in this repository, the component is backed by NATS file storage, but it could use other forms of blob storage (such as S3) via the standard `wasi:blobstore` API.

Cosmonic Control is built on [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.com/), an Incubating project at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/).

## Install Cosmonic Control

Sign up for Cosmonic Control's [free trial](https://cosmonic.com/trial) to get a `cosmonicLicenseKey`. **Note:** a `canary` installation is required to run the blobstore demo:

```shell
helm install cosmonic-control oci://ghcr.io/cosmonic/cosmonic-control --version 0.2.1 --namespace cosmonic-system --create-namespace --set cosmonicLicenseKey="<insert license here>" --set nexus.image.tag=canary --set operator.image.tag=canary --set console.image.tag=canary --set console_ui.image.tag=canary
```

Install a HostGroup with HTTP enabled. **Note:** a `canary` installation is required to run the blobstore demo:  

```shell
helm install hostgroup oci://ghcr.io/cosmonic/cosmonic-control-hostgroup --version 0.2.1 --namespace cosmonic-system --set http.enabled=true --set http.tag=canary --set image.tag=canary
```

## Deploy with Cosmonic Control

You will need a NATS installation on your Kubernetes cluster. Add the NATS repository to Helm:

```shell
helm repo add nats https://nats-io.github.io/k8s/helm/charts/
```

Install the NATS Helm chart with the `values.yaml` file below:

```shell
helm install nats nats/nats -f nats-values.yaml
```
```yaml
enabled: true
fullnameOverride: "nats"
nameOverride: "nats"
config:
  cluster:
    enabled: true
    replicas: 3
  leafnodes:
    enabled: true
  websocket:
    enabled: true
    port: 4223
  jetstream:
    enabled: true
    fileStore:
      pvc:
        size: 10Gi
    merge:
      domain: default
```

Deploy this demo to a Kubernetes cluster with Cosmonic Control and NATS using the included Helm chart:

```shell
helm install blobstore-nats ./chart/blobstore-nats
```

The chart is also available as an OCI artifact:

```shell
helm install blobstore-nats oci://ghcr.io/cosmonic-labs/charts/blobstore-nats --version 0.1.0
```

You can also deploy with the included CRD manifests:

```shell
kubectl apply -f ./manifests/
```

## Contents

In addition to the standard elements of a Rust project, the template directory includes the following files and directories:

- `wit/`: Directory for WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) packages that define interfaces
- `manifests/`: Example CRD deployment manifests for Kubernetes clusters with Cosmonic Control
- `chart/`: Helm chart

## Build Dependencies

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [`cargo`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 1.82+ for the Rust toolchain
- `wasm32-wasip2` target for Rust: Install with `rustup target add wasm32-wasip2`
- [Wasm Shell (`wash`)](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash) for component development

### Developing with `wash`

Clone the [cosmonic-labs/control-demos repository](https://github.com/cosmonic-labs/control-demos): 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cosmonic-labs/control-demos.git
```

Change directory to `blobstore-nats`:

```shell
cd blobstore-nats
```

Start a development loop:

```shell
wash dev
```

The component is accessible at localhost:8000. View the code and make changes in `src/lib.rs`.

### Clean Up

You can cancel the `wash dev` process with `Ctrl-C`.

## Building with `wash`

To build the component:

```shell
wash build
```

## What it does

The component performs a series of blobstore operations:

1. Container Operations:
   - Creates two containers (default: "ying" and "yang")
   - Verifies container existence
   - Retrieves container metadata

2. Basic Blob Operations:
   - Writes four blobs ("earth", "air", "fire", "water") to "ying" container
   - Reads back and verifies content
   - Demonstrates partial content reading (first 4 bytes)

3. Advanced Operations:
   - Moves "fire" from "ying" to "yang" container
   - Copies "water" from "ying" to "yang" container
   - Lists objects in both containers
   - Cleans up by clearing "ying" container

## Test the component

Once deployed, run the component by issuing the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```

The component will return a JSON response showing the results of all operations:

```json
{
  "container_ops": {
    "create_container": {
      "success": true,
      "message": "Created ying",
      "timestamp": "2024-12-05 16:30:00 UTC"
    },
    "container_info": {
      "success": true,
      "message": "Container ying created at 2024-12-05 16:30:00 UTC",
      "timestamp": "2024-12-05 16:30:00 UTC"
    }
    // ... more container operations
  },
  "blob_ops": {
    "write_blob": {
      "success": true,
      "message": "Wrote earth to ying",
      "timestamp": "2024-12-05 16:30:01 UTC"
    }
    // ... more blob operations
  },
  "container_names": ["ying", "yang"]
}
```
