# HTTP Server for Cosmonic Control

This is a simple HTTP server with multiple endpoints written in Go, implemented as a Wasm component and packaged for deployment to Kubernetes clusters with [Cosmonic Control](https://cosmonic.com/docs/).

The `.wasm` binary build output with any WebAssembly runtime that supports components and `wasi:http`.

### Install local Kubernetes environment

For the best local Kubernetes development experience, we recommend installing [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and starting a cluster with the following `kind-config.yaml` configuration, enabling simple local ingress with Envoy:

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
# One control plane node and three "workers."
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 30950
    hostPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
```

The following command downloads the `kind-config.yaml` from this repository, starts a cluster, and deletes the config upon completion:

```shell
curl -fLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmonic-labs/control-demos/refs/heads/main/kind-config.yaml && kind create cluster --config=kind-config.yaml && rm kind-config.yaml
```

## Install Cosmonic Control

You'll need a **trial license key** to follow these instructions. Sign up for Cosmonic Control's [free trial](https://cosmonic.com/trial) to get a key.

Deploy Cosmonic Control to Kubernetes with Helm:

```shell
helm install cosmonic-control oci://ghcr.io/cosmonic/cosmonic-control\
  --version 0.3.0\
  --namespace cosmonic-system\
  --create-namespace\
  --set envoy.service.type=NodePort\
  --set envoy.service.httpNodePort=30950\
  --set cosmonicLicenseKey="<insert license here>"
```

Deploy a HostGroup:

```shell
helm install hostgroup oci://ghcr.io/cosmonic/cosmonic-control-hostgroup --version 0.3.0 --namespace cosmonic-system
```

## Deploy with Cosmonic Control

Deploy this component to a Kubernetes cluster with Cosmonic Control using the shared HTTP trigger chart:

```shell
helm install http-server ../../charts/http-trigger -f values.http-trigger.yaml
```

You can also deploy the chart as an OCI artifact with a remote values file:

```shell
helm install http-server --version 0.1.2 oci://ghcr.io/cosmonic-labs/charts/http-trigger -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmonic-labs/control-demos/refs/heads/main/http-server/values.http-trigger.yaml
```

## Running on Kubernetes

Connect to the component at `http-server.localhost.cosmonic.sh`.

```shell
curl http-server.localhost.cosmonic.sh
```

### Send a request

You can send a request to the following endpoints:

**GET /**

Returns a list of available endpoints and their descriptions.

```shell
curl http://http-server.localhost.cosmonic.sh/
```
```text
  /error - return a 500 error
  /form - echo the fields of a POST request
  /headers - echo your user agent back as a server side header
  /post - echo the body of a POST request
```

**GET /error**

Returns a 500 Internal Server Error.

```shell
curl -v http://http-server.localhost.cosmonic.sh/error
```
```text
* Host http-server.localhost.cosmonic.sh:80 was resolved.
* IPv6: (none)
* IPv4: 127.0.0.1
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:80...
* Connected to http-server.localhost.cosmonic.sh (127.0.0.1) port 80
> GET / HTTP/1.1

/error - return a 500 error
  /form - echo the fields of a POST request
  /headers - echo your user agent back as a server side header
* Connection #0 to host http-server.localhost.cosmonic.sh left intact
  /post - echo the body of a POST request% 
```

**GET /headers**

Returns your User-Agent in the response headers.

```shell
curl -v http://http-server.localhost.cosmonic.sh/headers
```
```text
* Host http-server.localhost.cosmonic.sh:80 was resolved.
* IPv6: (none)
* IPv4: 127.0.0.1
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:80...

Check headers!
```

**POST /form**

Echoes back form data from a POST request.

```shell
curl -X POST -d "field1=value1&field2=value2" http://http-server.localhost.cosmonic.sh/form
```
```text
field2: value2
field1: value1
```

**POST /post**

Echoes back the entire body of a POST request.

```shell
curl -X POST -d "Hello World" http://http-server.localhost.cosmonic.sh/post
```
```text
Hello World
```

## Contents

In addition to the standard elements of a Go project, the template directory includes the following files and directories:

- `build/`: Target directory for compiled `.wasm` binaries
- `values.yaml`: Helm values for the shared HTTP sample chart
- `manifests/`: Example CRD deployment manifests for Kubernetes clusters with Cosmonic Control
- `wit/`: Directory for WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) packages that define interfaces

## Building Locally

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed in addition to the Go (1.23+) toolchain:

- [`tinygo`](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) for compiling Go (always use the latest version)
- [`wasm-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools#installation) for Go bindings
- [`wash`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash) for building the component

### Developing with `wash`

Clone the [cosmonic-labs/control-demos repository](https://github.com/cosmonic-labs/control-demos): 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cosmonic-labs/control-demos.git
```

Change directory to `http-server`:

```shell
cd http-server
```

Start a development loop:

```shell
wash dev
```

When using `wash dev`, the HTTP Server is accessible at localhost:8000. View the code and make changes in `main.go`.

You can cancel the `wash dev` process with `Ctrl-C`.

## Building with `wash`

To build the component:

```shell
wash build
```
