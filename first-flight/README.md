# First Flight

The page a freshly launched WebAssembly workload serves back on your own machine — the "you're flying" moment for [Cosmonic Desktop](https://cosmonic.com/)'s first-flight lesson.

It is a single Rust `wasi:http` component (no other capabilities) that serves one self-contained HTML page: brand-styled, gently animated, and honest about being a live program rather than a static file. The page shows the workload's name, the host it is answering on, a live clock, and a "Send another request" button that issues a genuine request the component handles.

The component is available as an OCI artifact at `ghcr.io/cosmonic-labs/control-demos/first-flight`. While it was written for Cosmonic Desktop and Cosmonic Control, it runs on any WebAssembly runtime that supports the Component Model and the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) HTTP API.

Cosmonic Control is built on [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.com/), an Incubating project at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/).

## Routes

| Route | Response |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /` | The First Flight HTML page. The workload name (from `FIRST_FLIGHT_NAME`, default `first-flight`) and the request authority are reflected into the page. |
| `GET /count` | `{"ok":true}` — the "Send another request" button calls this so each press is a real round-trip the component handles. |
| anything else | `404` |

The component is deliberately stateless: the runtime instantiates it per invocation, so the page's tallies are scoped to the visit and every increment corresponds to a genuine request. Nothing is faked, and no store or extra capability is required.

## Build

Requires the `wasm32-wasip2` Rust target and [`wash`](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation).

```shell
wash build
# or, directly:
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 --release
```

The component is written to `target/wasm32-wasip2/release/first_flight.wasm`.

## Run locally

```shell
# A local wasmCloud dev host on http://127.0.0.1:8000
wash dev

# or any WASI-HTTP runtime, e.g.
wasmtime serve -Scli target/wasm32-wasip2/release/first_flight.wasm
```

Then open the served address in a browser.

## Deploy on Cosmonic Control

`manifests/component.yaml` is an `HTTPTrigger` that runs the published image behind an ingress host. Apply it to a cluster running Cosmonic Control:

```shell
kubectl apply -f manifests/component.yaml
```
