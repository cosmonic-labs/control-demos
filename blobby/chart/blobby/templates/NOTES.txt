Blobby is serving on {{ .Values.component.hostname }}.

If the component is serving on the default port 9091, open a port-forward to the host group to access the application:

   kubectl -n cosmonic-system port-forward svc/hostgroup-default 9091:9091

In another tab, create a file with some content:

   echo 'Hello there!' > myfile.txt

Call the application through the port-forward:

   curl -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -v 'http://localhost:9091/myfile.txt' --data-binary @myfile.txt
